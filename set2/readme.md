TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week I learnt the many differences between each brackets that are used in programming. For example, round brackets are utilized for calling functions, defining tupels, wrapping line breaks and defining function arguments. Square brackets are used for defining lists and indexing these inputs into all collections. And the crab-like brackets are used to define dictionaries and sets. At times it is difficult for me to recall these differences as I am often referring to the course outline for help but  I hope to memorise these over time. 

The exercises in set 2 were a little bit tricky as we learnt how to modify different functions depending on what each doc string is asking for. In exercise 0 we learnt how to use string formatting in python. Although it would be a bit difficult as times when my lines of code would be entered incorrectly, I would be unable to successfully run my code as many errors would appear. To correct this, I had to re-evaluate. 

A crucial aspect I came across was learning about the practice of using docstrings to document each function argument comprehensively. This helped me improve the readability of my own code. The ability to set default values for function parameters eliminated the need for repetitive code and enhanced code reusability.
