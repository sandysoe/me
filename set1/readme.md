TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
For this week I learnt how to write a python script for "Hello World!" as well as running the tests in the terminal. The course website was very helpful towards this. 

After finishing my sets each week, I've learnt to commit and push my work to github to complete the full cycle of work. Pushing to github is important so that my tutors are able to see and evaluate my progress throughout each week. 

Although at times my changes wouldn't commit correctly as I would often forget to type something into the word bar for what changes I'm committing. The committing step is very important as once I have saved changes to my sets and exercises, I need to be sure that they have saved correctly, therefore committing these changes secures each saved change. Additionally, using git push I am able to share these committed changes, making them accessible to the tutors that later review my work. 

In summary, git commit saves repository changes on local repository, and git push then updates your git commit changes and sends it to remote repository.
