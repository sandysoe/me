TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week I learnt about the "requests" library in python. The function was very easy to understand, allowing me to make HTTP requests and work with responses in a straightforward manner. This simple concept makes it accessible me on a beginner level while still being powerful enough for advanced use cases. "Requests" provides an easy way to pass parameters and headers with your requests, allowing me to customize the given HTTP requests according to the specific needs. 

 Learning about how to handle the response data obtained from the requests is another crucial aspect. Whether the response is in JSON or plain text, understanding how to parse and extract relevant information from the response is essential in other exercises to come in later weeks. Working with "requests" had helped me explore testing techniques for HTTP requests. This is particularly useful when writing unit tests for code that involves making HTTP requests to external resources.
