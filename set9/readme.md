TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week I continued to make progress with my open data project. I was able to import the data as an excel file onto the vscode software. I was able to rewrite/rename the basic_pandas template with the correct functions that matched my dataset which gave me the correct statistical outcomes that reflected the data collected about animal complaints in Brisbane. 

Although it was a bit challenging as my data set included minimal numerical data. This is because it is more categorical data than continuous. The course outline website helped me extract numerical data from my pre-existing data through these functions:
do a df["column_name"].value_counts() which helped me get an idea of the counts that I will be working with.
do a df["column_name"].value_counts().plot(kind="bar") which helped me get an idea of the distribution of the counts.
