TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
This week I learnt about f-strings and its functions of supporting complex expressions. By uding curly brackets to enclose my python expressions, I was able to successfully execute calculations within the string. This allowed for more dynamic formatting as well as contributing towards more efficient and compact code, eliminating the unnecessary need for intermediate variables.

In exercise 2, I needed to evaluate the previous codes, notes and diagrams in order to successfully complete this set. As it was asking to make a guessing game that uses my super_asker code to process the inputs to make sure that they are the correct numbers. 

This week it was also important for me to find a dataset for the open data project. I was intersted in topics that investigated areas of food chains, public transport trends, animal behaviour trends, popular retail stores, etc.
